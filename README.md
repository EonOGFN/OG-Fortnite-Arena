## Kill Points

Points are automatically awarded by the backend system.
Only use the manual function if the points pop-up doesnâ€™t appear on screen.

## Placement and Victory Royale Points

- Use the format `(Placement, Points)` to give players points based on their placement.
- For Victory Royale, use `(1, x)` where `1` is first place and `x` is the amount of points to award.
- For example, Top 25 placement would use `(25, x)` with any point value you choose.
